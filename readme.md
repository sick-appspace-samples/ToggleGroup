## ToggleGroup
Demonstration of the ToggleGroup element and dropdown with options.
### Description
This sample shows how to put different elements into the ToggleGroup and bind them to the script and other UI elements. The ToggleGroup element is a layout-like control that can join several toggleable member elements. These elements share one value and selecting one member changes the shared value. The ToggleGroup can be bound to script serves or other sources/targets to change the selected value or update the selection. The UI also contains a DropDown with Options that can switch the value of the ToggleGroup.
### How to Run
